  # How does _following_point work with a long offset?
  # 
  # Let us suppose that the $self objet has an offset of 1000 days (about 2 years
  # and 9 months) and the event starting point $event_start_dt is 2018-10-03.
  # 
  # The following point will be in late 2018 or early 2019, which corresponds to an
  # Easter sunday in 2016. So we compute a starting point for Easter sunday by
  # subtracting the offset from the event starting point. 2018-10-03 - 1000 days
  # gives $easter_start_dt = 2016-01-07.
  # 
  # Next, we extract the year value and we compute the Easter sunday date.  This
  # gives $easter_sunday = 2016-03-27.
  # 
  # Then we add back the offset, which gives the final result 2018-12-22.
  # 
  # Now, suppose that the event starting point $event_start_dt is 2019-01-10. The Easter sunday
  # starting point $easter_start_dt is 2016-04-15.
  # 
  # Extracting the year value gives 2016, for an Easter sunday $easter_sunday = 2016-03-27, which is
  # before the Easter starting point 2016-04-15. So we try the next year, 2017,
  # for an Easter sunday $easter_sunday = 2017-04-16 and an event 1000 days later $event = 2020-01-11.
  # 
  # Lastly, suppose that the event starting point $event_start_dt is 2019-09-01. The Easter sunday
  # starting point $easter_start_dt is 2016-12-05. Since Easter cannot occur after 04-25 in any
  # year, so we do not bother to compute Easter for 2016, we directly compute the 2017 Easter sunday.
  # As above, we obtain an Easter sunday $easter_sunday = 2017-04-16 and an event 1000 days later 
  # $event = 2020-01-11.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The DateTime::Event::Easter module returns Easter events for DateTime
objects. From a given datetime, it can tell you the previous, the
following and the closest Easter event. The 'is' method will tell you if
the given DateTime is an Easter Event.

Easter Events can be Fat Tuesday, Ash Wednesday, Palm Sunday, Maundy
Thursday, Good Friday, Black Saturday, Easter Sunday, Ascension,
Pentecost and Trinity Sunday. If that's not enough, the module will
also accept an offset so you can get the date for Quasimodo (the next
sunday after Easter Sunday) by passing 7.

=head1 BACKGROUND

Easter Sunday is the Sunday following the first full moon on or
following the Official Vernal Equinox. The Official Vernal Equinox is
March 21st. Easter Sunday is never on the full moon. Thus the earliest
Easter can be is March 22nd.

In the orthodox world, although they now use the Gregorian Calendar
rather than the Julian, they still take the first full moon on or after the
Julian March 21st. As the Julian calendar is slowly getting further and
further out of sync with the Gregorian, the first full moon after this
date can be a completely different one than for the western Easter. This
is why the Orthodox churches celebrate Easter later than western
churches.

=head1 CONSTRUCTOR

=head2 C<new> constructor

This class accepts the following options to its C<new> constructor:

=over 4

=item * easter => ([western]|eastern)

DateTime::Event::Easter understands two calculations for Easter. For
simplicity we've called them 'western' and 'eastern'.

Western Easter is the day celebrated by the Catholic and Protestant
churches. It falls on the first Sunday after the first Full
Moon on or after March 21st.

Eastern Easter, as celebrated by the Eastern Orthodox Churches similarly
falls on the first Sunday after the first Full Moon on or after
March 21st. However Eastern Easter uses March 21st in the Julian
Calendar.

By default this module uses the Western Easter. Even if you pass a
Julian DateTime to the module, you'll get back Western Easter unless you
specifically ask for Eastern.

If this parameter is not supplied, the western Easter will be used.

=item * day => ([Easter Sunday]|Palm Sunday|Maundy Thursday|Good Friday|Black
Saturday|Fat Tuesday|Ash Wednesday|Ascension|Pentecost|Trinity Sunday|I<n>)

When constructed with a day parameter, the method can return associated
Easter days other than Easter Sunday. The constructor also allows an
integer to be passed here as an offset. For example, Maundy Thursday is
the same as an offset of -3 (Three days before Easter Sunday)
The numeric offset must be in the -80 .. +250 interval.

When constructed without a day parameter, the method uses the date for
Easter Sunday (which is the churches' official day for 'Easter', think
of it a 'Easter Day' if you want)

This parameter also allows the following abreviations: day =>
([Sunday]|Palm|Thursday|Friday|Saturday|Fat|Ash|Ascension|Pentecost|Trinity)

=item * as => ([point]|span)

By default, all returns are single points in time. Namely they are the
moment of midnight for the day in question. If you want Easter 2003 then
you actually get back midnight of April 20th 2003. If you specify 
C<< as => 'span' >> in your constructor, you'll now receive 24 hour spans
rather than moments (or 'points'). I<See also the C<as_span> and C<as_point>
methods below>

=back

=head1 METHODS

For all these methods, unless otherwise noted, C<$dt> is a plain vanilla
DateTime object or a DateTime object from any DateTime::Calendar module
that can handle calls to C<from_object> and C<utc_rd_values> (which should be
all of them, but there's nothing stopping someone making a bad egg).

This class offers the following methods.

=over 4

=item * following($dt)

Returns the DateTime object for the Easter Event after C<$dt>. This will
not return C<$dt>.

=item * previous($dt)

Returns the DateTime object for the Easter Event before C<$dt>. This will
not return C<$dt>.

=item * closest($dt)

Returns the DateTime object for the Easter Event closest to C<$dt>. This
will return midnight of C<$dt> if C<$dt> is the Easter Event.

=item * is($dt)

Return positive (1) if C<$dt> is the Easter Event, otherwise returns false
(0)

=item * as_list(from => $dt, to => $dt2, inclusive => I<([0]|1)>)

Returns a list of Easter Events between I<to> and I<from>.

If the optional I<inclusive> parameter is true (non-zero), the to and
from dates will be included if they are the Easter Event.

If you do not include an I<inclusive> parameter, we assume you do not
want to include these dates (the same behaviour as supplying a false
value)


=item * as_set()

Returns a DateTime::Set of Easter Events.

In the past this method used the same syntax as 'as_list' above. However
we now allow both the above syntax as well as the full options allowable
when creating sets with C<DateTime::Set>. This means you can call
C<< $datetime_set = $palm_sunday->as_set; >> and it will return a 
C<DateTime::Set> of all Palm Sundays. See C<DateTime::Set> for more information.


=item * as_span()

This method switches output to spans rather than points. See the 'as' attribute
of the constructor for more information. The method returns the object for easy
chaining.

=item * as_point()

This method switches output to points rather than spans. See the 'as' attribute
of the constructor for more information. The method returns the object for easy
chaining.


=back

=head1 SUBROUTINES

The  module provides  a few  subroutines giving  the elements  used to
compute the Easter date.

These  elements can  be found  in various  sources, including  what is
known in France as I<l'Almanach  du Facteur> (the postman's almanach).
These values are printed at the bottom of the February frame, which is
a  convenient way  to ensure  this frame  has the  same height  as the
frames for 31-day months.

These subroutines are not exported by default.

=over 4

=item * golden_number($year)

Gives the position of  the year in the Metonic cycle.  This is a 1..19
number.  We   do  not  use   the  0..18  arithmetic   modulo,  because
traditionally, the Golden Number is in the 1..19 interval.

This subroutine applies to both western and eastern computs.

=item * western_epact($year)

In the  Gregorian comput, the epact  is the age of  the ecclesiastical
Moon on the 1st January of the  given year. The C<western> part of the
subroutine  name  accounts for  the  fact  that Gregorian  and  Julian
calendars do not use the same formula.

The epact  is a 0..29 number.  The "0" value  is shown as "*"  in some
sources. This  subroutine does not convert  "0" to "*", the  result is
always a pure number.

Actually,  the western  epact  is  a little  more  than  a number.  As
explained by Paul Couderc (page 86)  and Jean Lefort (page 142), there
is a  special case for 25,  which should be considered  as two values,
"basic 25" and "alternate 25". "Basic 25" is printed as a plain number
C<25>, while "alternate 25" is printed  in a way that distinguishes it
from the other  numbers. Jean Lefort mentions C<XXV>  or using italics
or bold  digits, such as  B<C<25>>. This module prints  the "alternate
25" as "C<25*>".

=item * eastern_epact($year)

In the Julian comput, the epact  is the age of the ecclesiastical Moon
on 22nd March. The C<eastern> part of the subroutine name accounts for
the  fact that  Gregorian and  Julian calendars  do not  use the  same
formula.

The epact  is a 0..29 number.  The "0" value  is shown as "*"  in some
sources. This  subroutine does not convert  "0" to "*", the  result is
always a pure  number. There is no  other special case, for  25 as for
any other number.

The formula given by Reingold and  Dershowitz is a "shifted epact" and
gives  different  results from  the  values  printed in  Lefort's  and
Couderc's books. The module follows Couderc and Lefort.

=item * western_sunday_letter($year), eastern_sunday_letter($year)

On normal years (that is, excluding  leap years), the Sunday letter is
determined by tagging 1st January with  "A", 2nd January with "B", and
so on and looking at the first sunday of the year. The letter found at
this sunday if the sunday letter for the year.

The  sunday   letter  governs  all   conversions  from  (mm,   dd)  to
day-of-week. For example, if the letter is "F", then 1st January, 12th
February, 2nd July and 1st  October, among others, are tuesdays, while
6th January, 24th February, 14th July and 6th October are sundays.

On  leap  years, there  are  two  sunday  letters.  The first  one  is
determined  as above,  the second  one  is determined  by tagging  2nd
January,  not 1st,  with  "A".  The first  sunday  letter governs  all
conversions  from (mm,  dd) to  day-of-week for  January and  February
only, while the second sunday letter governs the conversions from (mm,
dd) to day-of-week for March and after.

So, if the sunday letters are  "FE", 1st January and 12th February are
still tuesdays,  but 2nd July and  1st October are wednesdays.  At the
same time, 6th January and 24th February are still sundays, while 14th
July and 6th October are mondays.

C<western_sunday_letter>  applies  only   to  Gregorian  years,  while
C<eastern_sunday_letter> applies only to Julian years.

=item * western_sunday_number($year), eastern_sunday_number($year)

Letters  (standalone or  in pairs)  are not  convenient for  numerical
calculations.  So  the   I<xxx>C<_sunday_number>  subroutine  is  used
instead of I<xxx>C<_sunday_letter>.

In case  of leap  years, the I<xxx>C<_sunday_number>  subroutine gives
the numerical value for the second sunday letter, because Easter never
falls in January or February.

=item * easter($year)

Given a Gregorian year, this method  will return a DateTime object for
Western Easter Sunday in that year.

=head1 BUGS AND PROBLEMS FOR SPANS

=head2 Inclusion and exclusion of C<from> and C<to> dates in lists and sets

If you build a list or a set of spans and if the C<from> or C<to> limits
coincide with the requested Easter event, the result may be different
from what you expect. For example, you ask for Easter sundays between
2017-04-16T21:43:00 and 2020-04-12T12:34:00.

The inclusive list or set will be:

  2017-04-16T00:00:00 to 2017-04-16T23:59:59
  2018-04-01T00:00:00 to 2018-04-01T23:59:59
  2019-04-21T00:00:00 to 2019-04-21T23:59:59
  2020-04-12T00:00:00 to 2020-04-12T23:59:59

and not:

  2017-04-16T21:43:00 to 2017-04-16T23:59:59
  2018-04-01T00:00:00 to 2018-04-01T23:59:59
  2019-04-21T00:00:00 to 2019-04-21T23:59:59
  2020-04-12T00:00:00 to 2020-04-12T12:34:00

The exclusive list or set will be:

  2018-04-01T00:00:00 to 2018-04-01T23:59:59
  2019-04-21T00:00:00 to 2019-04-21T23:59:59

and not:

  2017-04-16T21:43:01 to 2017-04-16T23:59:59
  2018-04-01T00:00:00 to 2018-04-01T23:59:59
  2019-04-21T00:00:00 to 2019-04-21T23:59:59
  2020-04-12T00:00:00 to 2020-04-12T12:35:59

Remarks and patches welcome.

Note for pedants: the hour C<21:43:01> should actually be
21 hours, 43 minutes, zero seconds and 1 nanosecond.
Likewise, all the times above ending with C<:59> include
999_999_999 nanoseconds.

=head2 Interaction of spans with timezones

It may happen that Palm sunday or Easter sunday coincide
with DST "spring forward" day (for Northern countries). I have not
checked what happens in this case for spans: a bit more than one day
for exactly 24 hours or exactly one day which gives 23 hours?
A similar question exists for DST "fall backward" day in the Southern
countries.

Also, since you can use a numeric C<day> offset up to 250, you can reach
the Northern "fall backwards" and the Southern "spring forward" days, where
the same problem will happen in reverse.
